This is a System Architecture Diagram based off of our lab in class. I used the same methodology that we learned in class to apply my learning to a real world example. I incorporated an example from my personal life. I used my Dad's home office for a reference and my Brother's room. My Dad's office is located right next to my Brother's room, which is convenient for both parties because the wiring isn't too far apart from each person's end devices. I used desktop PCs as end devices wired to switches and connected to the same router. I am pretty sure this is how it is physically set up in my house, but not accurate to the IP addresses or types of hardware.
