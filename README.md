This is a System Architecture Diagram based off of our lab in class. I used the same methodology that we learned in class to apply my learning to a real world example. I incorporated an example from my personal life. I used my family's home office for a reference and a friend's home office. I used desktop PCs as end devices wired to switches and connected to a router.
